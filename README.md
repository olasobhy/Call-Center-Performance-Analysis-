# Call-Center-Performance-Analysis-

## Overview
This project analyzes call center performance using Python for data processing and Power BI for visualization. It provides insights into agent activity, language-based handling, and efficiency metrics such as average handling time and pass rates.

## Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

Power BI

## What I Did
Cleaned and prepared call center data using Python

Calculated key metrics: number of calls, AHT (Average Handling Time), std_pass, etc.

Exported the processed data for visualization

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze:

Calls by language and day

Agent performance

Monthly pass rates

## Key Metrics Tracked
Total agents: 1,485

Total languages: 2

Total calls: 5,398

AHT per language and agent

Daily and monthly call patterns

Std pass by month and agent
